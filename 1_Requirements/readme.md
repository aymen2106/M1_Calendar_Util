# Requirements
## Introduction
* The project is titled as calendar and developed using C language. It is used to display month by month calendar of a given year. The primary practical use of a calendar is to identify days: to be informed about or to agree on a future event and to record an event that has happened. Days may be significant for agricultural, civil, religious, or social reasons.

## Advantages
* It keeps us accountable. Scheduling my most recent doctor's appointment reminded me of how valuable appointments are.
* It keeps us realistic. When planning out tasks and activities on the calendar, be realistic.
* It helps us prioritize.
* It keeps us on track.
